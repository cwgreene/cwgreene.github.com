Pari documentation read. Probably should have done this the first time.

## Pari Documentation

Main things of note: `avma` corresponds to the top of the pari stack
(pari stack is managed separately than the normal stack, presumably
so that it can be made much larger than the usual stack).

The following previously mysterious functions are related to stack
management:

```
cgiv - free most recent object
grepile - frees memory in the stack with a range and then
proceeds to validate that there are no hanging pointers.
```
