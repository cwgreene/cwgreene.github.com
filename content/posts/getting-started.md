Alright, so I opted to go for using Hugo as the
static content generator.

Ultimately, I ended up just building it from source
with 

```
go install -tags extended github.com/gohugoio/hugo@latest
```

which, (after removing `asdf` shims from my toolpath) just
worked. Don't use the `apt-get` version, it'll be old and
incompatible with random themes you come across online.

Tricky bit is setting up the Github workflow pipeline.

For this week, I'm not going to have a week plan I think
(subject to change, otherwise this would be a plan ;) ),
just setup daily goals.

Goals Today:
  - Get Hugo up and running on github.
  - Finish reading 'Chip Wars' and publish notes.
  - Get OpenFOAM up and running and figure out how
    to have moving boundary conditions.
  - Groceries.
